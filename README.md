# C++ Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
This is a grid pathfinding visualizer built using OpenGl, GLFW, GLAD, and ImGui.
# Usage
Only works on Windows. To use, clone or download this repo and go into the *scripts* folder.
There is a windows batch file there that you can execute and it will build the Visual studio 2022 solution.
## Algorithms
### Breadth-First-Search (BFS)
**Unweighted** and **guarantees** shortest path.
### Depth-First-Search (DFS)
**Unweighted** and does **not** guarantee shortest path.
### Dijkstra
**Weighted** and **guarantees** shortest path.
### A*
**Weighted** and **guarantees** shortest path.
## Program Features
### Grid Resizing
By using the Up and Down arrow keys, you are able to resize the grid.
### Animation speed up
By using the Left and Right arrow keys, one can speed up or slow down the algorithms execution.
### Start and Pause
Can start or pause the algorithm using the UI or with the space bar.
